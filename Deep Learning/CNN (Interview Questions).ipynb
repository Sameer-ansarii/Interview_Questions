    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A common practice is to start with a small number of filters in the first layer and gradually increase the number of filters in subsequent layers. For example, in a basic CNN architecture, the number of filters might be set as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`First Convolutional Layer`**: Fewer filters, e.g., 32 or 64.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Intermediate Convolutional Layers`**: Increasing number of filters, e.g., 128, 256, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Final Convolutional Layer`**: The number of filters can be set to the number of classes in the classification task (for classification problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the number of filters can also depend on the available computational resources and the size of the dataset. Larger numbers of filters increase the model's capacity to learn intricate patterns but also increase the computational cost and the risk of overfitting if the dataset is small.\n",

    "### How to specify correct input shape of images while creating dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the image size (image_size) when creating a dataset of images depends on various factors, including the characteristics of the dataset, the available computational resources, and the requirements of the specific deep learning model or task you are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point, image sizes such as (256, 256) or (224, 224) are commonly used in various computer vision tasks. These sizes are often chosen because they strike a balance between maintaining relevant details in the images and computational efficiency.\n",

    "### What will happen if we incease the number of convolutional layers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding more convolutional layers can make the model more complex and difficult to train, but it can also improve the model's performance by extracting more features and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Increased complexity`**: Adding more convolutional layers will increase the complexity of the CNN model. This can make the model more difficult to train, but it can also improve the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Improved feature extraction`**: More convolutional layers can extract more features from the input data. This can improve the model's ability to recognize patterns in the data and make more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Reduced overfitting`**: Adding more convolutional layers can help to reduce overfitting. This is because the model will be able to learn more features from the data, which will make it less likely to memorize the training data and generalize better to new data.\n",

A smaller mini-batch size can help to prevent overfitting, but it can also make the training process slower. A larger mini-batch size can speed up the training process, but it can also increase the risk of overfitting.\n",

    "The optimal mini-batch size depends on the specific problem and the dataset. However, a good starting point is a mini-batch size of 32 to 128.\n",
