    "\n",
    "Cross validation is a technique for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. It involves dividing the data set into two parts: a training set and a test set. The model is trained on the training set and then evaluated on the test set. This process is repeated multiple times, and the average accuracy of the model is calculated."

    "K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the data into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different fold as the test set and the remaining folds as the training set. The performance metrics are then averaged across all iterations to obtain an overall assessment of the model's performance."

    "K-fold cross-validation randomly splits the data into k folds, which may result in an imbalance in class distribution across the folds, especially for small datasets. Stratified k-fold cross-validation addresses this issue by ensuring that each fold has a similar class distribution as the original data. It preserves the proportion of samples from each class in each fold."

The validation set helps in comparing different models or parameter configurations and selecting the best performing one."
