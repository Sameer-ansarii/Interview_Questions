    "### Q) What is class imbalance in machine learning?\n",
    "Class imbalance refers to a situation where the classes in a classification problem are not represented equally. One class (the majority class) has significantly more samples than the other class(es) (the minority class(es)). Class imbalance can pose challenges for machine learning algorithms, as they tend to be biased towards the majority class and have lower predictive performance for the minority class."

    "### Q) Why is class imbalance a problem in machine learning?\n",
    "Class imbalance can lead to biased models that have poor performance on the minority class. The model tends to predict the majority class most of the time, resulting in low sensitivity/recall for the minority class and a high false negative rate. Class imbalance can also cause issues with model evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, as even a simple majority class prediction can yield high accuracy due to the imbalanced class distribution."
