    "### Q) What is Support Vector Machine (SVM)?\n",
    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds an optimal hyperplane that maximally separates data points of different classes or predicts the target value for regression. SVM aims to find the best decision boundary by maximizing the margin between the classes."

Hard margin SVMs are only possible if the data is linearly separable. If the data is not linearly separable, then a hard margin SVM will not be able to find a decision boundary that separates all of the data points correctly.\n",

This is done by introducing a slack variable that allows the decision boundary to move away from some of the data points.
