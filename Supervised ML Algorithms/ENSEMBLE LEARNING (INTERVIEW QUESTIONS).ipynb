    "Adaboost is an iterative ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. Weak classifiers are models that perform slightly better than random guessing. The algorithm assigns higher weights to misclassified instances in each iteration, allowing subsequent weak classifiers to focus on these instances and improve their predictions. Adaboost adjusts the weights based on the errors made by the previous classifiers and constructs a final strong classifier by weighing the predictions of all weak classifiers.\n",

    "**2) `Gradient Boosting`:**\n",
    "Gradient boosting is an iterative ensemble method that sequentially adds weak learners to a model. However, unlike Adaboost, which adjusts weights, gradient boosting optimizes a loss function by minimizing it through the use of gradient descent. In each iteration, a new weak learner is fit to the residual errors made by the previous learners. The algorithm uses gradient descent to find the optimal direction in the feature space that reduces the loss function the most, gradually improving the model's predictive performance.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parallel Processing: XGBoost supports parallel processing, making it faster than traditional gradient boosting implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling Missing Values: XGBoost has built-in mechanisms to handle missing values automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built-in Cross-Validation: XGBoost supports cross-validation within the training process to assess model performance.\n",
